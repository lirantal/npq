## About

Once npq is installed, you can safely* install packages:

```bash
npq install express
```

`npq` will perform the following steps to sanity check the package is safe:
* Consult snyk.io database of publically disclosed vulnerabilities to check if a vulnerability exists for this package and its version.
* If no match is found, it continues with the following syntactic herustics:
	* Package age on npm
	* Package download count, popularity
	* Package has a README file
	* Package has pre/post install scripts

If npq is prompted to continue with the install it simply handover the actual package install job to the package manager (npm by default).

*safely - there's no guaranteed safety, a malicious or vulnerable package could still exist that has no discloure published and passes npq's checks.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g npq
```

## Usage

### Install packages with npq:

```bash
npq install express
```

### Embed in your day to day

Since `npq` is a pre-step to ensure that the npm package you're installing is safe, you can safely embed it in your day-to-day `npm` usage so there's no need to remember to run `npq` explicitly.

```bash
alias npm='npq'
```

### Offload to package managers

`npq` by default will offload all commands and their arguments to the `npm` package manager after it finished its due-dilegence for the respective packages.

If you're using `yarn`, or generally want to explicitly tell npq which package manager should handle the command use one of the following methods:

* A command line option: `--packageManager <npm|yarn>`
* An environment variable: `NPQ_PKG_MGR=yarn`

Example: create an alias with yarn as the package manager:

```bash
alias npm='npq --packageManager yarn'
```
