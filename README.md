## About

Once npq is installed, you can safely* install packages:

```bash
npq install express
```

`npq` will perform the following steps to sanity check the package is safe by employing syntactic heuristics and querying a CVE database:

* Consult snyk.io database of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities to check if a vulnerability exists for this package and its version.
* Package age on npm
* Package download count as a popularity metric
* Package has a README file
* Package has pre/post install scripts 

If npq is prompted to continue with the install it simply handovers the actual package install job to the package manager (npm by default).

safely* - there's no guaranteed safety, a malicious or vulnerable package could still exist that has no disclosure published and passes npq's checks.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g npq
```

## Usage

### Install packages with npq:

```bash
npq install express
```

### Embed in your day to day

Since `npq` is a pre-step to ensure that the npm package you're installing is safe, you can safely embed it in your day-to-day `npm` usage so there's no need to remember to run `npq` explicitly.

```bash
alias npm='npq-hero'
```

### Offload to package managers

If you're using `yarn`, or generally want to explicitly tell npq which package manager to use you can specify an environment variable: `NPQ_PKG_MGR=yarn`

Example: create an alias with yarn as the package manager:

```bash
alias yarn="NPQ_PKG_MGR=yarn npq-hero"
```

Note: `npq` by default will offload all commands and their arguments to the `npm` package manager after it finished its due-diligence for the respective packages.

## Marshalls

| Marshall Name | Description | Notes
| --- | --- | --- 
| age | Will show a warning for a package if its age on npm is less than 22 days | Checks a package creation date, not a specific version
| downloads | Will show a warning for a package if its download count in the last month is less than 20
| readme | Will show a warning if a package has no README or it has been detected as a security placeholder package by npm staff
| scripts | Will show a warning if a package has a pre/post install script which could potentially be malicious
| snyk | Will show a warning if a package has been found with vulnerabilities in snyk's database | For snyk to work you need to either have the `snyk` npm package installed with a valid api token, or make the token available in the SNYK_TOKEN environment variable and npq will use it

### Disabling Marshalls

To disable a marshall altogether set an environment variable using with the marshall's shortname.

Example, to disable snyk:

```
MARSHALL_DISABLE_SNYK=1 npq install express
```
